# Bill of Materials
In the full version of the **Music Festival Manager** applicaion with multitenancy, SAP ERP integration, and additional features, the **Music Festival Manager** application  uses a number of subaccounts and entitlements.
These subaccounts include two types: a provider subaccount, where the application is deployed, and consumer subaccounts, which contain customer-specific information and configuration.
